    <c-paragraph>
      In this course, I'll cover the basics of how to write your own compiler and/or interpreter. Theoretically, you could write your own python interpreter after finishing this course, even if it probably wouldn't be as fast as the official ones.<br>
      We won't be covering such things as optimization (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling">loop unrolling</a>, for example), but we'll cover the basics of how you could find such patterns. I'll leave the rest up to you.
    </c-paragraph>
    <c-paragraph>
      Throughout this course, we'll be implementing two languages:
      <ul>
        <li>A basic calculator language</li>
        <li>A basic scripting language</li>
      </ul>
      The course will be written in JavaScript, so that we can execute the code we write as we go.
    </c-paragraph>
    <c-paragraph>
      The course is split up into four lessons. Each lesson in turn is split into two: a basics section, covering the creation of the calculator language, and an advanced section, covering the scripting language.<br>
      Each lesson will also have some homework assignments. These are obviously optional (what am I going to do, give you a failing grade from my nonexistent school?), but they might make it easier for you to follow along, and understand what's happening.
    </c-paragraph>
    <c-paragraph>
      The lessons available are listed below. Click on where you'd like to start from (I'd recommend lesson 0 or 1), and go from there.<br>
      Note that you can move between lessons using the left and right arrows on the header, once on a lesson page.
