					Sorry that the site is a pain to look at.<br/>
					I am a programmer, not a designer after all.

			<div class="paragraph">
				My name is Max (screen name 'TheNamlessGuy'). I am a programmer who in 2017 finished the program <a href="https://liu.se/utbildning/program/6kipr">Innovativ Programering</a> at
				<a href="https://liu.se/">LiU</a>, and is currently working at the consulting firm <a href="https://www.hiq.se/">HiQ</a> (specifically HiQ Ace).
				I am fairly proficient in a number of languages, but my main languages are (in no particular order):
				<ul>
					<li>C/C++</li>
					<li>Python</li>
					<li>Java</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
            <div class="paragraph">
				I started programming in school at about 17, and I haven't stopped since (except for when I play games).<br/>
				My favorite programming languages are C/C++. I list both at the same time, since I tend to prefer writing C code, but sometimes using the C++ standard library.
				I tend to prefer languages where I can myself determine exactly what is happening, which is very easy in C/C++ (except maybe in modern C++, but that's a whole different issue).
				The best example I have is the fact that it is always the programmer who determines if a value is pass by reference or pass by value in those languages, while in for example Java, all objects are always pass by reference (unless you do some really obscure voodoo).
