            Hi! My name is Max (although I usually go by 'TheNamlessGuy' as a screenname). I'm a programmer who in 2017 is going to graduate from the program
            <a href="https://liu.se/utbildning/program/6kipr">'Innovativ Programering' at LiU</a>.
          </p>
          <div id="languages">
            During the program we were taught a number of different languages, and the ones I'd say I'm proficient in are (in no particular order):
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>C/C++</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Ruby (I have not tried RubyOnRails yet, but it would probably not be difficult to learn)</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>JavaScript (including Node.js, etc)</li>
          </ul>
          <div id="personal">
            A bit about me: I started programming in school at about 17, and I haven't stopped since, except for when I play games. <br/><br/>

            My favorite programming languages are C/C++ (which usually ends up being a C++ program with some C-style coding in there for good measure). <br/>
            I do very much enjoy sitting as close to the hardware as you can do in those languages, while still having <i>some</i> abstraction <br/><br/>

            My favorite game series are (again, in no particular order): The Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls and The Legend of Zelda <br/>
            It's always been a dream of mine to make games, but mostly in my spare time. The dream is to make my games my way, after all <br/> <br/>

            The courses at uni I found the most interesting were (most of these links will only have the latest updated things in the swedish version):
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDP019/index.en.shtml">TDP019</a>, where we got to implement a parser for our own programming language</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDC17/index.en.shtml">TDDC17</a>, a voluntary course in AI</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDP030/index.en.shtml">TDP030</a>, a voluntary course in language technology</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDP005/current/">TDP005</a>, where we got to make our own game in C++ (as a practice in Object Oriented Programming)</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~TDIU25/current/index.en.shtml">TDIU25</a> and <a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~TDIU16/current/index.sv.shtml">TDIU16</a>, in which we implemented our own OS (built on PintOS)</li>
          </ul>
