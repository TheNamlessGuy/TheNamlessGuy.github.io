      <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/wandersong">Wandersong</a> is a fantastic story/character-driven puzzle platformer about a bard who, even though he is not the chosen one, still tasks himself with stopping the end of the world through the magical power of song and (optionally) dance.
      It's genuinely one of my favorite indie games, if not games in general. If you haven't checked it out yet do so now, since this will obviously contain spoilers.<br>
      I should mention that by doing this I am by no means saying the Wandersong ending is bad. However, have you ever had that feeling of annoyance when you find something that's so close to your interpretation of perfect,
      only to have it diverge just a bit, leaving you more annoyed than anything, just because of how close it came? That's what the original ending is to me, and to let off some of the steam I wrote this.

    <h2 class="italic text-left">Here be spoilers</h2>

    <c-paragraph>
      All throughout the game, the bard (who will hereby be referred to as Piet, since that's what I named him) is told that he is <b>not</b> the chosen one.<br>
      Despite this, the ending of the game is a last-minute-hero-saves-the-day-and-is-the-chosen-one-in-everything-but-name ending.
      This disappointed me, since a big part of the charm of the story (for me) is tied to the fact that he isn't the chosen one, but he's doing his best anyway.

    <c-paragraph>
      The game basically ends when the Dream King dies. The world starts to collapse in on itself and Piet, having failed in his task of getting the Earthsong together, gives it his all with what he's got,
      and ends up with what is referred to as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u0wg3t6osM">Wandersong</a>. All the people he had met around the world join him in chanting the song.
    </c-paragraph>

    <c-paragraph>
      Now, at this point is where I would diverge. In the real game Eyala informs you that the goddess Eya heard this and decided to not scrap the world after all,
      and then everyone lived happily ever after. I feel this goes against the idea of Piet not being the chosen one, so I propose this instead:<br>
      Eya does indeed hear you and everyone else singing, but the collapse is too far gone. You get a scene where Eyala talks to Eya, and she says that she was moved by the fact that everyone in the world wanted it to continue being.
      She says that she will implement another failsafe in the next iteration of the world, where if everyone unites and wishes for the world to not end, it won't.<br>
      The credits start rolling, and we see short clips/stills of another bard (the only real difference being that this one has baby blue clothing) going around doing the same quest you as the player just did,
      the implication of course being that this is the Piet of the next world iteration. The credits end as Piet 2.0 sings the Wandersong, but this time the world is saved.
    </c-paragraph>

    <c-paragraph>
      That's it. Personally, I feel this ending is more inline with what the rest of the story was trying to convey. But, again, this is of course just my take on it. The real ending is what the devs intended, after all.
