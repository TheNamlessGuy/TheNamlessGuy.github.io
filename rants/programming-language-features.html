        <h1>Programming language features</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Often when coding I run into instances where I really want a feature to exist, or I really want one to not.
          I plan to list them here so I can vent about this dumb shit somewhere.
        </div>

        <div id="toc"></div>

        <h2>Features all languages should have</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Things I have encountered in some languages, or just things I really want to be able to do.
          <div>
            <h3>Function parameter constants</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              I stole this one from Erlang (although it's probably existing in other languages). Basically, say you have a function like this in some language:
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                func myCoolFunc(int param, bool reversed) {
                  if (reversed) {
                    cFunc(param);
                    bFunc(param);
                    aFunc(param);
                  } else {
                    aFunc(param);
                    bFunc(param);
                    cFunc(param);
                  }
                }
              </div>
              A dumb example, but it serves its purpose. Now, imagine you could write it like this instead:
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                func myCoolFunc(int param, true) {
                  cFunc(param);
                  bFunc(param);
                  aFunc(param);
                }

                func myCoolFunc(int param, false) {
                  aFunc(param);
                  bFunc(param);
                  cFunc(param);
                }
              </div>
              See how <i>objectively</i> better that is?
            </div>

            <h3>Default function parameter values</h3>

              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                func cool(int param = 0) {

            <h3>Python-style parameter specification</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              In python you can specify a parameter out of order by referencing it by name. This is a very useful idea.
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                func cool(int param1 = 0, param2 = 0) {
                  // ...
                }
                cool(param2 = 1);
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Scope creation control</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              I often find myself thinking that I want to break code out to a function in order to make it
              more readable, but this will come at a runtime cost of a scope creation, which isn't great.<br>
              Granted, that's not really a huge major issue that every language immediately needs to turn their attention to,
              but that's what got me to start thinking about it. There are four types of scopes the programmer should be able to create:
              <ul>
                <li>No scope - Simply don't open a new scope when entering the code block</li>
                <li>Closed scope - The code block can't access anything declared outside of it</li>
                <li>Open declaration scope - The code block has its own scope, but can access things declared in the scope(s) above where it was created</li>
                <li>Open call scope - The code block has its own scope, but can access things declared in the scope(s) above where it was called</li>
              </ul>
              The 'no scope' one fixes the original issue I experienced. With this I would no longer feel bad anytime I need to write a 'random number between' function.
              This can of course be used as a 'injectable' code block as well (which is basically the same thing but the phrasing makes me think of other scenarios it could be used).
              <br>
              The 'closed scope' is good in a few scenarios. Callback functions not holding the exact scope they were created in hostage until they get discarded
              (JavaScript developers probably understand this, as this is basically the issue with 'arrow functions'),
              and it should probably be used in most for-loops and such.<br>
              "Oh but what if I want to use only one or two variables from the above scope?", you may be asking. This is where we yoink the <span class="code">use()</span> syntax from PHP.
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam" data-keywords="use" data-symbols="{c">
                int a = 5;
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) use(a) {c
                  a += i;
                }
              </div>
              This syntax obviously wouldn't work for closed scope functions, and I'm not sure how the syntax would look for that, but I figure it can't be difficult to solve. Perhaps:
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam" data-keywords="requires" data-symbols="{c">
                func myfunc() requires(a) {c
                  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
                    a += i;
                  }
                }

                int a = 5;
                myfunc()(a);
              </div>
              The 'open declaration scope' is basically what we are used to in most modern languages. This should probably be default.<br>
              The 'open call scope' is very specific when it needs to be used. Its usecase lies when you need an inline function that needs to create variables
              but shouldn't tarnish the 'parent' scope.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Conditional 'ternary' operator but for non-value results</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              This sounds weird, but generally I stole it from bash:
              <span class="code" data-lang="bash" data-names="mybool">[[ mybool ]] && echo "yes" || echo "no"</span>.
              Granted, this isn't syntax you really should use out of really basic testing (in bash), but imagine if you <i>could</i>.<br>
              The more observant reader might have noticed I put ternary in quotations in the header for this section, and that's because (much like in bash)
              I figure you should also be able to do <i>just</i> the good or bad one, and have a noop otherwise. This is an example syntax:
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                (mybool) ? doYesThing() : doNoThing();
                (mybool) ? doYesThing();
                (mybool) ?: doNoThing();
                int myint = (mybool) ?: doNoThing(); // Should either result in syntax error, or have the value of myint persist when mybool == true
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Pointers/references and allowing the programmer to decide between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Most people in the business seem to have nightmares about pointers from back in their earlier programming days, but they are insanely useful from time to time.<br>
              I added the name 'reference', since you can pretty much abstract away the idea that it points to a memory address in most languages and have it change absolutely nothing.
              I prefer using the word 'reference', but that's mostly because the pointer syntax in C++ is absolute ass, while the reference syntax is how it should be.<br>
              <br>
              The main point of this section isn't the actual pointers however, but what they let you as a programmer do: you get to decide whether you want to pass-by-reference or not.
              This is something most languages seem to want to absolutely fuck you over with. In my experience, most languages have pass-by-value sometimes and pass-by-reference in other cases,
              even if the syntax itself looks exactly the same. This is incredibly user-unfriendly, and I don't really understand why most people just roll over and accept it.
              It's probably the leading thing for any bugs I write or issues I face in those types of languages.
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                // Disgusting! Ew! Spit on it! Ptooey
                MyClass c = new MyClass(abacus = false);
                func myfunc(MyClass c) {
                  c.abacus = true;
                }
                myfunc(c);
                print(c.abacus); // => true
              </div>
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                // Wonderful
                MyClass c = new MyClass(abacus = false);
                func myfunc(MyClass c) {
                  c.abacus = true;
                }
                myfunc(c);
                print(c.abacus); // => false
                myfunc(&c);
                print(c.abacus); // => true

            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Constructors with return values</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Basically, exceptions are bad and ugly, and we should use this instead. I'll let the code speak for itself on this one:
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                // Good version
                class MyClass {
                  constructor(int inparam1, bool inparam2) {
                    if (inparam1 > 5) {
                      return null;
                    }

                    parent(); // Creates an object of type MyClass and sets it to this
                    this.myint = inparam1;
                    this.mybool = inparam2;
                    return this;
                  }
                }

                MyClass c = new MyClass(7, false);
                if (c === null) {
                  print('Uh oh, spaghetti-os');
                }
              </div>
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                // Bad version
                class MyClass {
                  constructor(int inparam1, bool inparam2) {
                    if (inparam1 > 5) {
                      throw new YouDidItWrongException('inparam1 no bigger than 4 pls tanks');
                    }
                    this.myint = inparam1;
                    this.mybool = inparam2;
                  }
                }

                MyClass c; // We could at least get rid of this if we had scope control, see that subsection.
                try {
                  MyClass c = new MyClass(7, false);
                } catch (YouDidItWrongException e) {
                  print('You did it wrong');
                }
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Multiple inheritances</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              I really don't see why this would be an issue ever. The biggest issue is the 'two parents have the same function' issue people keep bringing up,
              but the compiler should easily be able to see that any call to the function is ambiguous, and should then prompt you to specify which of them you are calling.
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                class Parent1 {
                  func foo() { /* ... */ }
                };
                class Parent2 {
                  func foo() { /* ... */ }
                };

                class Child: Parent1, Parent2 {
                  func bar() {
                    foo(); // Compilation error
                    Parent1::foo(); // Perfectly fine
                  }
                };
              </div>
              Some languages work around this by use of interfaces (which isn't really a solution to the problem.
              Granted, it might not have been intended to be, but people keep saying it is), or traits.<br>
              I will say that traits are a step in the right direction, and is basically how inheritance should work from the get-go,
              but at least in my experience any language that has one also has the other, which is just incredibly redundant.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Events</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Basically the only thing I liked about C# is that you can subscribe to a variable changing value, and influence said value.
              This would be great to use for something like a video game perk/status effect system.
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                class DoubleIncome: Perk {
                  // ...
                  static onActivation() {
                    onChange(player.money, func(value) {
                      if (value < player.money) { return value; }
                      return player.money + (value - player.money) * 2;
                    });
                  }
                }
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>finally on <i>all</i> code blocks</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Any time you open a connection to a server or some such and you need to shut it down at the end of a function,
              the only real choice you have is to wrap the function in a try-catch.
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                func doTheThing() {
                  Connection conn;
                  try {
                    conn = connect();
                    // ...
                  } finally {
                    conn.close();
                  }
                }
              </div>
              Obviously this is incredibly ugly. Now check a look at this:
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                func doTheThing() {
                  Connection conn = connect();
                  // ...
                } finally {
                  conn.close();
                }
              </div>
              <i>Hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng</i>, as the kids say. Much cleaner. Of course, you should be able to do the same with if-statements, loops, etc.<br>
              I'd draw the line at class code blocks, since they're not really executed as much as evaluated. Perhaps if you wanted to execute some code after
              object creation? But given the <a data-tocme>constructor with return value</a> <!-- TODO --> thing from above, you could just put a finally on the
              constructor. Anyway, the same scenario but with a loop instead of a function:
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                Connection conn = connect();
                while (true) {
                  // ...
                } finally {
                  conn.close();
                }
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Labels</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Labels in general are pretty good to use, at least when used in conjunction with <span class="code">break</span> and <span class="code">continue</span>, etc.
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                #outer while (true) {
                  // ...
                  #inner while (true) {
                    if (/* ... */) {
                      break #outer;
                    }
                  }
                }
              </div>
              For clarification, that <span class="code">break</span> would get you out of both loops.<br>
              Now imagine if you could do it with <span class="code">return</span> statements as well. This would be pretty useless without the
              <a href="#features-all-languages-should-have---finally-on-all-code-blocks">finally on all code blocks</a> from above. But with it, you could suddenly do a lot.
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                func foo() {
                  if (/* ... */) { return 1 #ret1; }
                  if (/* ... */) { return 'abababbaba' #ret2; }
                  if (/* ... */) { return 'bababaabab' #ret3; }
                } finally #ret1 {
                  // Handle ret1 specifically
                } finally {
                  // Handle all other cases
                }

            <h3>Function overloading</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Not gonna go too deep into this one, it should be obvious why it's useful.
              Especially with the <a href="#features-all-languages-should-have---function-parameter-constants">function parameter constants</a> mentioned above.

            <h3>Objects/Hashmaps and JavaScript-style access syntax</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              If there's anything JS did right, it's the object access syntax. Allowing you do do the <span class="code">dict['value']</span> thing when you absolutely need to,
              but also giving you the freedom to make it actually readable with the <span class="code">dict.value</span> syntax.<br>
              For this reason (and some others), I say all languages should have some sort of builtin hashmap (in its standard lib or not) and have the same syntax.
              While I can agree that the keys should be locked to strings for the sake of simplicity, the value should be whatever type you want it to be.

            <h3>Multiple return values</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              It's just really useful. Steal the spreading syntax from any language that has it:
              <div class="code" data-lang="nam">
                func myfunc() {
                  return [1, false];
                }
                [int a, bool b] = myfunc();
              </div>

            <h3>No public, protected, private, or similar</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              This is one of by biggest gripes. There are only two reasons you would ever set something as not public:
              <ul>
                <li>You do not trust the people who will interface with your code</li>
                <li>You think you are smarter than the people who will interface with your code</li>
              </ul>
              You should always trust the people that interface with your code, because it is purely their fault
              if they break something on their end. They shouldn't be messing with parts of your code that they do not understand. They should, however,
              be allowed to use any of your code <i>if</i> they do understand it.<br>
              The quality of your code is not tied to what people do with it. It stands on its own merit.<br>
              <br>
              Now, you might still want to flag that a variable or a function isn't intended to be used outside unless you absolutely know what you're doing.
              This issue was solved by python programmers ages ago however: prefix the name with a '_'.

            <h3>Redeclaring variables</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Controversial, I know. But sometimes I need throwaway variables when debugging and I can't keep using <span class="code">tmp</span>.
              But in a typed language I might need it to be an int in one point of the code, and a string in another. Thus, redeclaration.

              Now, in some cases multilevel inheritance will actually improve your code, which is why I put this in this category. But if you've ever spent any time
              with a hardcore Java programmer (or just OOP in general), you'll probably understand why I absolutely loathe this concept.<br>
              If you haven't had the pleasure, check out the Eclipse source code and see how many levels of abstraction any given class is.
              Pretty sure I found one that was over 30 classes deep at one point.

              Exceptions should only be available if you specify a flag to your compiler/interpreter, so it can be used in debugging.
              No production build should ever have exceptions if it can help it.<br>
              If you do have exceptions in production, at least make it so you <i>have</i> to handle them in your code.
              An exception should never bubble up past your main function.
