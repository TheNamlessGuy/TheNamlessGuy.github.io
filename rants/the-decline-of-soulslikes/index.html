    <c-paragraph>
      Since the title of this is admittedly very clickbaity, I will start this off by saying that this obviously is all my opinion. Even if something is <i>presented</i> as fact, it's a fact <i>to me</i>. With that being said, I want to start off this rant by detailing my experience watching the soulslike genre morph into what it has become today. I feel this approach gives the later reasoninings some much needed perspective.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h2>Some background</h2>
    <h3>Foreshadowing - Demon's Souls</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      Demon's Souls released in 2009, when I was 15. I remember reading about it in a gaming magazine, and wanting to play it desperately. Unfortunately, I was mainly a Nintendo kid, and when I eventually<c-footnote>I think it was the previous christmas?</c-footnote> branched out, I got an Xbox, as all my friends at the time had chosen the Microsoft path. I would eventually play it, but not for a long time. And it was too bad, since I really wanted a dark fantasy RPG.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h3>The Golden Age - Dark Souls</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      My journey with the souls series really started with me watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_XqGBfpM20iat3zztiO9JgoRHh19jyIB">let's play of Dark Souls</a>. While watching it, I quickly realized two things: this looked very similar to the game I read about a few years ago, and that it was available on PC.<br>
      Since I was still studying at this time, I didn't have a lot of money. I had to live vicariously through the let's play until I managed to get enough money to buy the game. Thankfully, I had previously bought an Xbox controller with a cord for my Xbox, so I didn't have to suffer through it with keyboard controls. If I had, I don't think I would have fallen for it in the same way I did.
    </c-paragraph>
    <c-paragraph>
      I loved basically everything about it. The combat was slow and methodical, and it rewarded you for staying calm in a stressful situation. The weapon variety was large, and offered you a massive amount of playstyle options. If you wanted to play it fast, you could play it <i>fast</i>. The slower playstyle characters would have a hard time keeping up with you, but they also did a lot more damage when they managed to land a hit. The balancing felt immaculate. The bosses reflected the same thing. Most were fairly slow, and once you figured out their patterns they were quite easy. Then you face against Artorias, arguably the best fight in the franchise. He's quick. He's ruthless. The lore had built him up to be a badass, and the fight delivered.<br>
      Speaking of, the world building was fantastic as well. Not necessarily that it was well written, but the way it was presented worked perfectly for what they were trying to do. You were playing in a broken, dying world, and the lore reflected it. You could see traces of old battles, old kingdoms, hear tales of ancient knights. But since there were only a handful of people left, you never really got the full story. It really made me feel like an archeologist, trying to piece together the events of the past by the shreds of information that remained.<br>
      I started playing quite late in the game's lifespan, which resulted in me not being invaded constantly. The few times I was, they were very respectful. I don't think I met a single player that didn't bow, wave, or otherwise made sure I was ready before we faced off. I distinctly remember getting invaded in Seath's garden. My estus was empty, so I used it to show the invader that I didn't have any heals left. The invader then dropped me some souls and left. It felt like the community cared about other people having a good time playing more than anything else.
    </c-paragraph>
    <c-paragraph>
      The community in general was a big reason why I fell for the game as well. There were plenty of people on YouTube trying to explain the lore, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyA8odjCzZ4">memes</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdiew8MUa38">were</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywyll7GUG5Q">fantastic</a>. The phrase "git gud" is memed to hell these days, but back then - at least in my experience - it was largely used as a funny way of saying "just keep trying, you'll get it eventually". It's also with this game that the term 'souls-game' first started appearing, which eventually spun into 'soulslike' when others tried to copy the formula. The term back then was however far stricter than it is now.

    <h3>The Premature Nail in the Coffin - Dark Souls II</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      When Dark Souls II was announced, I was hyped as hell. I loved the first game so much, so the second one has to at least be decent, right? Little did I know how right I would end up being.
    </c-paragraph>
    <c-paragraph>
      For the uninitiated: Dark Souls II is largely considered the worst in the series. It did a lot of things very right, but it also did a lot of things very wrong. It took the series further in the slow, methodical direction, meaning it felt a lot heavier to play than Dark Souls. In my opinion, this was the correct way for the series to go. However, a rushed development cycle resulted in a game that failed to deliver on a lot of the points the original had been praised for - the famous examples being the level design of Earthen Peak leading into Iron Keep, and the entire concept of soul memory.<br>
      The bad far outshone the good, and since Dark Souls II was overall deemed bad, all its changes - individually good or bad - were deemed the same. That, coupled with the massive success of the next release, pretty much put the final nail in the coffin for the direction of the entire genre going forward.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h3>The Beginning of the End - Bloodborne</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      A new, standalone from the creators of the now infamous Souls series? Boy were people hyped up. Personally, being a fan of gothic and cosmic horror, I was very pleased with the aesthetic. However, the fast, more reaction-based combat didn't speak to me as much. I didn't have a PS4 on the time of its release, so I wouldn't play this entry until much, <i>much</i> later.<br>
      Don't get me wrong, I like the game. What I didn't like was the direction it was twisting the genre I liked so much. The slow, methodical way of playing that was so prevalent in the earlier entries was gone. My way of playing was gone.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h3>Dusk - Dark Souls III</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      The third and final entry in the series. I bought it immediately, and as soon as I started fighting the tutorial boss, a seed of doubt was planted in the back of my head. Iudex Gundyr was fast. His moves were flashy and over-the-top. The halfway transformation, while great in the context of the game, felt like a step away from the more grounded combat of the earlier entries in the series.<br>
      Back then I couldn't put my finger on what felt off. I was still enjoying the game immensely, but something was telling me that it wouldn't quite live up to what I had envisioned the game to be. Mechanics-wise, the game was more Bloodborne 2 than it was Dark Souls 3.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h3>Confirmation - Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      The announcement of Sekiro was really what cemented my fears. FromSoftware were just going to keep leaning into the fast paced, more bombastically designed combat. The design was no longer just about feeling good to play, but also to be flashy to look at.<br>
      I liked Sekiro, but the genre had at this point twisted so far that it no longer felt like the same thing. The elements that I had liked the most had been cast away.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h3>Rot - Elden Ring</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      The entire premise of an open world soulslike is a strange one. The tightly designed world was no longer possible. Instead, most of the land was designed to be ran through as quickly as possible. Perhaps it was the explosive success the genre had seen for its PvP streams and memes, which both directly and indirectly encouraged people to run through the games to "get to the good parts" that influenced the decision. Perhaps the developers wanted to make an open world game, but knew that it wouldn't do well if they didn't follow the design patterns they were known for.<br>
      It was with the release of Elden Ring that the term "soulslike" essentially devolved into "combat focused game where currency and EXP are the same thing, which you lose on death - but you have an option to get it back". No longer did the world building matter. The stamina bar? Sekiro threw that out. The slow, methodical combat? Bloodborne tossed it in the dumpster. The remains were barely recognizeable, given its roots.
    </c-paragraph>
    <c-paragraph>
      It's also with Elden Ring that the genre (in my opinion) ventured too far into the bombastic design. In Dark Souls, when Artorias jumped and slid around, it worked. The lore had basically built him up to be the biggest badass there ever had been, and it showed. In Elden Ring, everyone is the biggest badass there ever has been. Bosses jump three times their height regularly. Attacks are designed like an over-the-top anime, where flash is more important than readability.<br>
      The theme of rot was appropriate for the game. The corpse of the soulslike genre had been rotting for a while, but this is where it was noticable that the head, arms, and legs had rotted off. The core - the torso still remained, but it was hardly reminiscent of what it once was.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h3>Pee Soaked Grave Soil - Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      Having played this DLC was largely the reason I wanted to write this. It took everything that was bad with Elden Ring, and tripled it. I don't really mind the open world aspect, even if only the "legacy dungeons" feel like actual souls content. What I do mind is the atrocious ways they changed combat. All the boss attacks are pure flash. With the last boss, that's true in a literal sense as well. In the second half of the fight, my screen was pure white about 10% of duration. Every boss is an endurance round, where one single miss is more likely to send you back to the beginning than not. Perhaps it was developer difficulty seeping through. Perhaps there was a desire to design the DLC to look good for let's plays and livestreams. Looking at the attacks in an editor, they do admittedly look great. From a player perspective, they're barely readable.<br>
      I did beat the DLC, but I have no desire to go back and play it again. Not because I felt like I had gotten what I could out of it, but rather that it just wasn't enjoyable. I could see myself going back and playing any other game in the series, but this DLC really soured the taste of not just itself, but of any future FromSoft releases. If this is the direction they're heading, I'm no longer on board.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h2>The Consequences</h2>
    <c-paragraph>
      As I said in the beginning, the parts above are largely there to give some context to the complaints below. Here, my complains will be listed more clearly.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h3>Reaction time over learning</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls II were all about studying your enemy, waiting for an opening. Post-Bloodborne, the genre has instead morphed into "create an opening". Both are enjoyable ways to play, but why is the slower, more methodical type of combat seemingly completely missing? Instead of learning movesets, you just have to react to each individual moment.<br>
      This, like most of the complaints, is particularly prevalent in Elden Ring. Will the boss do the third and final swing this time, or will they stop at two like they sometimes do? You have no idea, as it's not readable from the start of the combo. Turns out it was two this time, but you missed your window trying to look for the third attack. Try again in five minutes, when the next opening is scheduled.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h3>The Demand for Perfection</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      In the early days, if you messed up a dodge, block, parry or whatever, you'd be punished - but you weren't likely to immediately die. Missing a dodge pretty much meant that you had to heal, and with a limited amount of heals, you had a set number of failures before you had to restart. At most, you'd probably fight a boss a dozen times or so.<br>
      In the later games - and Elden Ring especially - you miss something, you're more likely to die than not. It's not really a question of "just level health more" - the game is seemingly designed around this level of difficulty. This means that, if you meet a boss you're having trouble with, you might end up playing the first half of the fight thrice the amount of time you'd spend on the latter half. That level of repetition just isn't enjoyable.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h3>Style Over Substance</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      The early games' animation style was very grounded. If it was a guy with a sword, he would swing his sword. If he had a shield, he would block with it. He may do an occasional jump attack or similar, but it largely felt realistic, within the context of the universe.<br>
      Arguably from Dark Souls III and onwards, the focus seemed to shift. Instead, it started introducing flashier maneuvers. Enemies would slide around on the floor, jump, do spin attacks, and generally act more light fantasy than dark fantasy. To me, this feels like a clash with the concept of the genre. It doesn't feel like you're struggling against someone who just has more experience than you, but rather someone who is innately just better.<br>
      Couple that with the fact that such attacks are harder to read, and it leaves a sour taste.
    </c-paragraph>
    <c-paragraph>
      Granted, Artorias did do most of the things, but (as I've stated above), he was basically the only one. In lore, he was this extreme badass, who could do shit no one else could. When even your basic bitch enemies do it, it just makes the whole experience feel less grounded.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h3>Removing Player Progress</h3>
    <c-paragraph>
      I've never been a fan of mechanics that feel like they remove player progress. Enemies that heal themselves, have multiple health bars, and so on. Granted, all of the games listed have this issue if you count invaders that heal, but the games also have the key difference in that you can stop them from doing so - if you're skilled enough.<br>
      For example: instead of multiple health bars, I much prefer bosses that have a long ass health bar, where you enter phase 2 after 50% or whatever. There are some exceptions, but they're mostly gimmicks (see the Guardian Ape in Sekiro).
    </c-paragraph>
    <c-paragraph>
      This design pattern seems to be more and more common, and the good alternatives becoming less and less. It ties together with the Style Over Substance argument, as both of them make the games feel less grounded.
    </c-paragraph>

    <h2>Closing statements</h2>
    <c-paragraph>
      That's it for now. I might revisit this rant whenever I play a new soulslike. Here's to hoping that it will be with good news.
