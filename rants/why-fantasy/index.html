      <h1>Why fantasy?</h1>
      <c-rant>

            I would argue that, when it comes to fiction, there are three genres that represent the best the medium has to offer: fantasy, science fiction, and horror.
            Each of these give something special to the medium that the others cannot capture as well.

            Horror is probably the easiest to explain, given that the clue is in the name: the best works in the genre have always been about exploring the depths of human dread.
            Famous works would include Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Bram Stoker's Dracula, pretty much all of H.P. Lovecraft's works, and arguably most cautionary tales such as
            Aesop's Fables, along with any given story by the Brothers Grimm. Of course, some of these represent what I'm trying to convey better than others,
            so I'll focus on one to begin with: Lovecraft.
          </div>
          <div>
            Most (if not all) of Lovecraft's works revolve around two ideas: the insignificance of humans in the eye of the cosmos, and/or
            (on the opposite side of things) the fact that humans, quite innately, fear the unknown. While a small piece of it, this represents the type of subject matter the horror
            genre is the best tool for exploring: horror (like I said, the clue is in the name).
          </div>
        </c-paragraph>

            In the same vein, sci-fi has traditionally explored societal and large-scale issues facing all of humanity. For example,
            'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' questions what it truly means to be human, and through that also discusses racism (albeit on a fairly abstract level).
            1984 discusses the dangers of letting the state get too much power over the common man. Starship Troopers (the book) advocates for the need for war.
            Of course, you do not need to agree with the sentiments of all of these stories, but the ideas are still there.
          </div>

            Fantasy, on the other hand, has in the modern day mostly been associated with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xHsAMik9VM">The Hero's Journey</a> type stories.
            Fantasy can absolutely shine in these types of stories, but it is far from the only thing it can do. For example, take the old tales of Norse mythology:
            To someone who doesn't believe in the religion itself, they are at the end of the day fantasy stories. While it's true that a lot of them <i>do</i> follow the trend of The Hero's Journey,
            a lot of them do not (or not exclusively). It's in these segments where I feel fantasy shines the brightest, as we get to explore more of the emotional and/or spiritual sides of humanity.
            This is the type of fantasy I want to explore. Of course, there are other sides of it that are important to me as well (building a world that seems grand and magical, yet still realistic, for example), this is the main reason I prefer fantasy over the other genres mentioned.
