Only thing I would really change is the leveling system, as I feel only leveling up from your major skills is kind of boring.
Instead, make it so any skill under 25 gives you a debuff for everything to do with it, have your major skills start at 25, and make it so you level up from all skills.

Maybe fix the difficulty curve as well. Did Battle of Kvatch at level 14 or something, and I just flat out couldn't beat it with my character build.`,

    "description": `The music is great, the voice acting ranges from great to passable, and the gameplay is... severely lacking. Spoilers after this.
In the first section, I dug up the tank before anything else, which led to the story itself seeming disjoined and weird, at least for that section. There was no clear path, no clear way of telling which thing to go for first.
The open landscape itself is a major detriment to the gameplay in general, as you just blindly press W to move forward with functionally nothing to guide you in the right direction. The player is often left to wander aimlessly in order to progress, especially if you want to explore - which the game (at least vocally) encourages.
The "stand and bow on three rocks" segment took way longer than it should have, mostly because it took me until the third rock to understand that you're supposed to bow when the thing is IN the rock, not when it's floating above. Obviously, this is very counter-intutitive, as you've been collecting light orbs for 90% of the game up until this point.
The night time level I had to restart twice because I kept chasing the second deer, and kept running in that direction until I hit the edge of the map and subsequently fell off. As opposed to what the game tells you to do with the first deer, you are NOT supposed to chase them, but stand on the little island behind them and listen to the story until the next deer emerges. That is, except the last one. That one you're supposed to chase.
Personally, I also felt that the map-to-map transitions were very disjointed. During the title sequence you see the tree in the distance, so I expected to have a seamless journey to the tree, where I could always see it in the distance. Alas, instead you go from snowy mountain top to green forest in the blink of an eye.

The entire game feels disjointed and strange, but there is definite potential (if you're into walking simulators). It's apparently the creators first game, and for that I'd say it's passable. Here's a list of things I'd say needs working on if they are going to make something similar in the future:
* Weave the gameplay and the story together better
** If you're telling a linear story, make sure you guide the player so that they experience it in the correct order
** Make the players journey map at least somewhat to the story being told, outside of cutscenes. This happened once in the game: When you had to jump over that big cliff
*** It doesn't have to be a literal mapping either, it could also be something more metaphorical. The narrator starts to doubt himself, so the path forward becomes narrow and hard to navigate, or something in that sense
* Do not just have big open world spaces with nothing in it
** Introduce SOME mechanic for making traversal more interesting. A climbing mechanic? Rolling down hills? Anything that breaks up the monotony of "Hold W"`,

Don't get me wrong, if the show had started out at the season 3 stuff, it definitely wouldn't have had the same impact. You pretty much needed the prior two seasons to set it up, to give the moments that extra oomph.
The latter half of season 3 and most of season 4 does feel like a return to formula though, but all throughout that part of the show there's this underlying feeling of something else going on, which pays off perfectly in the finale.`,

    "description": `HERE BE SPOILERS for Dragon Prince, Avatar - The Last Airbender, and Legend of Korra.

I'm probably too harsh on this show, mostly because it has to live up to the near-masterpiece that is ATLA, but there is something about it that just feels off.

I can't help but compare the two. In no particular order:
* Soren is by and large the "comic relief". While Sokka was THE comedy guy in ATLA, it feels like the other characters also had an equal amount of comic relief. In TDP, it feels like 70% of the jokes are either from Soren, or about Soren.
* I can't for the life of me care even a bit about Ezran (I had to look his name up). He feels like a mary sue and a soap box rolled into one. He has no flaws that can't be handwaved away as him being a kid. He can telepathically communicate with animals because reasons (most likely so he can talk to his bird-dad whenever that plot point gets resolved). It feels like Ezran (I had to scroll back to recheck his name) is supposed to be the new Aang, but they give him none of the complexity that made Aang an interesting character. Aang had the weight of the world on him, but he could barely handle it due to being a kid. Erzan gets an entire kingdom dumped on him, and he goes "sigh... alright sure" and then is the gigachad can't-do-anything-wrong-king who just wants peace when every one else wants war because he is the good guy and the others aren't. Yes, Aang could be preachy at times as well, but that was easily explained by his upbringing and, you know, the fact that he was the Avatar. Ultimately, Ezran (I remembered it this time) is just some kid who can talk to animals because plot.
* Speaking of soap boxing, I feel like the show does a lot of it. ATLA did this as well, but it went about it much better. In ATLA, if you wanted to say "Don't do the thing", they show the characters you (the viewer) care about doing the thing, the implications doing the thing has to their relationships with the other characters, and just in general show WHY it's bad, while at the same time showing why you might actually do the thing. In TDP, it feels very much like they just say "People who do the thing are bad" and then they fight the people who do the thing. Afterwards, the good guys win, and they say "See, doing the thing doesn't lead you anywhere". To be fair, this is a trend I feel I see more and more in general, not just with this show. Personally, I blame Twitter.
* It seems very much like the implication of the elves dialects is that all the sun elves should have the french-ish accent, but some of them just don't? Half of Rayla's hunting team didn't have the accent.
* The entire first season feels rushed. Sort of in the same way Korra Book 1 did, but at least that had the entire previous show to build on.

Not to say that TDP doesn't have its moments.
* As with ATLA, the world building is really good. Not as good as in ATLA, but that's probably because ATLA had double the amount of episodes at its disposal in order to build up the world.
* I did NOT expect that whole "Soren becomes a quadraplegic" arc, which I feel was well executed. The only downside being that the only real lasting result of that arc is that Claudia gets a white streak in her hair.
* The idea of watching Zym growing up is neat. Him being named after Ozymandias is kind of funny also, well done.
* I didn't like bait the first time I watched the first season, but now by season 4 he is one of my favorite characters. They manage to squeeze a lot of personality out of the little bit of screen time he has.
* Callum doing dark magic once and regretting it, but it still having lasting implications even after the time skip is a very well fired Chekhov's gun.
* The Aaravos mystery being set up from episode one makes it the most intriguing arc the series probably has to offer. I am just guessing at this point, but he is going to end up being either inside the magic cube, or somewhere in Katolis. Also, he's voiced by Erik Dellums, who - to me - will always be Three Dog ([insert howl here]) from Fallout 3, and that makes me happy.

Ultimately, I think a lot of the issues I have with the show probably boil down to two major things:
1) It has half the episodes per season that ATLA did. A lot of the world and characters don't get as fleshed out as they seem to be in the writers heads because of this.
2) Even if they had gotten the time required in point 1, I feel like it would have been used for more soap boxing, and less character building. Again, I blame Twitter.`,

The animation is top tier, once you get over how different it looks from everything else.
The attention to detail is amazing (how Tsukimoto's little foot dash things are sci-fi-ish in nature when he's in robot mode, while Hoshino's are the cartoony hand drawn style is just incredible).
Not to mention how it all feeds into telling the story so damn well.`,

    "description": `SPOILERS! The show had a great start, and just fumbled the ending completely, to the point where I lost basically all interest.
The entire premise of the show is based on having a set amount of characters whose storylines slowly converge. This is handled fantastically for about 80% of the plotlines.
The first plotline we ever get introduced to is an old man reading a story to a young girl. Seemingly, this plotline was just completely forgotten, as it's brought up maybe one more time, but never goes anywhere.
The plotline of the guy in the white tux gets about 75% done, then just stops.

"You need to watch the OVAs!", you say. First of all, the story already concluded. You can't just patch together a second ending because you forgot to end some plotlines. Second of all, within the first 5 minutes of the first OVA, we:
1) Are off the train (which was the entire premise of the show)
2) Introduce new characters (completely missing the point of what made the original premise so interesting)
I stopped watching halfway through the first OVA, just because it felt like a desperate attempt to either keep the money flowing, or to "fix" the misses in the actual ending.

If it had resolved the remaining plotlines within the premise of the train, and not start introducing new characters, this would easily have been an 8/10. It's honestly sad that they fumbled the ending so hard.`,

It does a fantastic job of this by constantly shifting between a sitcom format when the titular Kevin is around, and a seriously shot drama piece the rest of the time.
It all really highlights how much presentation can condition us into thinking something very much not funny to be funny, as long as you don't dwell too much on it.
Ran for the perfect amount of time, given the subject matter, and stuck the landing beautifully.`,

    "description": `Where do you even start? The ubisoft open world design? The characters that you're not really given a reason to care about? The fact that 90% of the game feels like a generic fantasy thing, with no relation to the franchise whatsoever? The combat at least starts out fun, but quickly devolves into tedium (although unlocking the explosive barrel thing near the end was a nice change of pace).

This is a mediocre game by most metrics. Any open world game has two tasks to fulfill:
1) Have a big, sprawling, beautiful open world - this game checks that box.
2) Make the world feel rewarding to explore (not just through sheer amount of content, but also through variety) - this is where the game (like any other ubisoft open world game) fails.

There are a lot of things I could go into and nitpick (the console-first design that cripples the PC experience, the map being SO SLOW TO OPEN PLEASE I JUST WANT TO LOOK WHERE I'M GOING, the same four-ish enemies over and over, ...), but I'll simply say this:
The focus in development was clearly the quests. Follow the developers directive, and focus on the quests as well. Ignore actually exploring the world, and just look at it as it passes by below, when you fly on your broom. If you like Harry Potter, this'll scratch that itch.

And yes, I did 100% the game.`,
