It really is insane how much better the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhB5oQgQpOI">alternate ending</a> is. I understand that the official ending is the one they planned from the beginning, and if you look at it from where the show started, it makes sense.

What <i>doesn't</i> make sense is ignoring the last 6 or so seasons of character growth that made it so the original ending no longer fit. They could have built towards the official ending better by, for example, <i>not</i> showing that Ted and Robin just don't fit together, and that every time they try, it ends awfully.

With the alternate ending, I'd bump it up to a 7.5/10.

    "description": `The pacing is all over the place, especially in the beginning. Nothing ever feels like it's given room to land.

But, on the other hand, that's one of the strengths of the film. Seeing all the underhanded shit Barnum does (not actually drinking anything during The Other Side, for example) is a large part of why I enjoy it so much. The first half movie is set from his own perspective of sorts, painting him like a good person, but as the movie goes on, it puts more and more focus on the fact that he really is just... conniving?

Music is great. Choreography (especially in the two bar scenes) is top tier.`,

    "description": `One of my favorite games. It has a LOT of jank, and a lot of things that are frustrating, but it also has a shitton of heart. At the end of the day, that's all that really matters.

Spoilers from here on out.

To go into the jank/nitpick aspects:
* Camera angles don't are chosen without seemingly caring about whether or not all characters are on screen, if there is something inbetween the camera and what the player is supposed to look at, and other such small issues. Doesn't affect the major dialogues, but some of the run of the mill ones suffer
* Object pop-in/pop-out happens all the time. This was fixed for me by a <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Heaven%27s_Vault#Issues_fixed">regedit change</a>: <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Inkle Ltd/Heaven's Vault/UnityGraphicQuality_h1669003810</code> => Base: decimal, Value data: 100
* The game heavily relies on the fact that you SHOULD NOT be save scumming. It saves after every decision you make, even if you didn't realize it was a decision to begin with. There are a few times I chose a dialog option which lead to me being locked out of stuff to do. Doesn't really matter at the end of the day, as you can always beat the game without seeing that content. On the other hand, FOMO
* Some of the UI elements bug out, and you have to work your way around them. Words scroll off screen, and won't let you scroll them back on (easily at least - it's always possible), for example
* It does feel like a mobile port in some places
* The music doesn't seem to know if it wants to play or not some times
* Interesting, world-building dialogue sometimes gets interrupted (with no way of getting back to it) by "Hey remember to turn left"
* Moving is <i>slow</i>
* It's not always clear <i>why</i> Aliya doesn't let you start/continue a translation. The difference between a full translation situation and an "I give up" situation feel random, even if there probably is logic behind it.
* The language doesn't do enough to differentiate itself from an english cipher. Sentence structuring is much the same, and so on. But I can understand that doing it any other way would alienate a much larger portion of the audience.

The shit I absolutely adore:
* A <i>lot</i> of effort has gone into crafting the language. You can very early on determine stuff like "if this symbol exists, it negates something", "if a symbol is surrounded by these two symbols it's a thing (read: noun)", and so on.
** I genuinely got excited whenever I got a new prompt, even if it was some random cloth from some abandoned ruin.
* The artstyle, while simplistic, is great
* The sailing is very relaxing, and the controls of it feel just right. It was annoying that you couldn't skip them when you repeated routes, but that has since been patched.
* The story is told in a very intriguing way. You get dripfed information at just the right pace, and the narrative changes quite drastically depending on your choices (even if you didn't realize it). You always reach the sea, but there are many rivers to take on the way.
** There are actual repercussions to your actions, unintentional or not. Just like in real life.
* All the characters are distinct, even the ones that are "one-offs"`,

Only thing I would really change is the leveling system, as I feel only leveling up from your major skills is kind of boring.
Instead, make it so any skill under 25 gives you a debuff for everything to do with it, have your major skills start at 25, and make it so you level up from all skills.

Maybe fix the difficulty curve as well. Did Battle of Kvatch at level 14 or something, and I just flat out couldn't beat it with my character build.`,

    "description": `The music is great, the voice acting ranges from great to passable, and the gameplay is... severely lacking. Spoilers after this.
In the first section, I dug up the tank before anything else, which led to the story itself seeming disjoined and weird, at least for that section. There was no clear path, no clear way of telling which thing to go for first.
The open landscape itself is a major detriment to the gameplay in general, as you just blindly press W to move forward with functionally nothing to guide you in the right direction. The player is often left to wander aimlessly in order to progress, especially if you want to explore - which the game (at least vocally) encourages.
The "stand and bow on three rocks" segment took way longer than it should have, mostly because it took me until the third rock to understand that you're supposed to bow when the thing is IN the rock, not when it's floating above. Obviously, this is very counter-intutitive, as you've been collecting light orbs for 90% of the game up until this point.
The night time level I had to restart twice because I kept chasing the second deer, and kept running in that direction until I hit the edge of the map and subsequently fell off. As opposed to what the game tells you to do with the first deer, you are NOT supposed to chase them, but stand on the little island behind them and listen to the story until the next deer emerges. That is, except the last one. That one you're supposed to chase.
Personally, I also felt that the map-to-map transitions were very disjointed. During the title sequence you see the tree in the distance, so I expected to have a seamless journey to the tree, where I could always see it in the distance. Alas, instead you go from snowy mountain top to green forest in the blink of an eye.

The entire game feels disjointed and strange, but there is definite potential (if you're into walking simulators). It's apparently the creators first game, and for that I'd say it's passable. Here's a list of things I'd say needs working on if they are going to make something similar in the future:
* Weave the gameplay and the story together better
** If you're telling a linear story, make sure you guide the player so that they experience it in the correct order
** Make the players journey map at least somewhat to the story being told, outside of cutscenes. This happened once in the game: When you had to jump over that big cliff
*** It doesn't have to be a literal mapping either, it could also be something more metaphorical. The narrator starts to doubt himself, so the path forward becomes narrow and hard to navigate, or something in that sense
* Do not just have big open world spaces with nothing in it
** Introduce SOME mechanic for making traversal more interesting. A climbing mechanic? Rolling down hills? Anything that breaks up the monotony of "Hold W"`,

Combat is a bit simplified to the earlier entries, but the addition of the STRONG/AGILE style thing is neat.
Alpha thing really interesting, having Pokemon actually attack the player is as well.

Everything just works very well, for what it is. Hope they continue the Legends series, and that they expand on the gameplay further.`,

Then season 3 started, and it went to places I did NOT expect the show to go, especially in the first half. Don't get me wrong, if the show had started out at the season 3 stuff, it definitely wouldn't have had the same impact. You pretty much needed the prior two seasons to set it up, to give the moments that extra oomph.
The latter half of season 3 and most of season 4 does feel like a return to formula though, but all throughout that part of the show there's this underlying feeling of something else going on, which pays off perfectly in the finale.`,

    "description": `HERE BE SPOILERS for Dragon Prince, Avatar - The Last Airbender, and Legend of Korra.

I'm probably too harsh on this show, mostly because it has to live up to the near-masterpiece that is ATLA, but there is something about it that just feels off.

I can't help but compare the two. In no particular order:
* Soren is by and large the "comic relief". While Sokka was THE comedy guy in ATLA, it feels like the other characters also had an equal amount of comic relief. In TDP, it feels like 70% of the jokes are either from Soren, or about Soren.
* I can't for the life of me care even a bit about Ezran (I had to look his name up). He feels like a mary sue and a soap box rolled into one. He has no flaws that can't be handwaved away as him being a kid. He can telepathically communicate with animals because reasons (most likely so he can talk to his bird-dad whenever that plot point gets resolved). It feels like Ezran (I had to scroll back to recheck his name) is supposed to be the new Aang, but they give him none of the complexity that made Aang an interesting character. Aang had the weight of the world on him, but he could barely handle it due to being a kid. Erzan gets an entire kingdom dumped on him, and he goes "sigh... alright sure" and then is the gigachad can't-do-anything-wrong-king who just wants peace when every one else wants war because he is the good guy and the others aren't. Yes, Aang could be preachy at times as well, but that was easily explained by his upbringing and, you know, the fact that he was the Avatar. Ultimately, Ezran (I remembered it this time) is just some kid who can talk to animals because plot.
* Speaking of soap boxing, I feel like the show does a lot of it. ATLA did this as well, but it went about it much better. In ATLA, if you wanted to say "Don't do the thing", they show the characters you (the viewer) care about doing the thing, the implications doing the thing has to their relationships with the other characters, and just in general show WHY it's bad, while at the same time showing why you might actually do the thing. In TDP, it feels very much like they just say "People who do the thing are bad" and then they fight the people who do the thing. Afterwards, the good guys win, and they say "See, doing the thing doesn't lead you anywhere". To be fair, this is a trend I feel I see more and more in general, not just with this show. Personally, I blame Twitter.
* It seems very much like the implication of the elves dialects is that all the sun elves should have the french-ish accent, but some of them just don't? Half of Rayla's hunting team didn't have the accent.
* The entire first season feels rushed. Sort of in the same way Korra Book 1 did, but at least that had the entire previous show to build on.

Not to say that TDP doesn't have its moments.
* As with ATLA, the world building is really good. Not as good as in ATLA, but that's probably because ATLA had double the amount of episodes at its disposal in order to build up the world.
* I did NOT expect that whole "Soren becomes a quadraplegic" arc, which I feel was well executed. The only downside being that the only real lasting result of that arc is that Claudia gets a white streak in her hair.
* The idea of watching Zym growing up is neat. Him being named after Ozymandias is kind of funny also, well done.
* I didn't like bait the first time I watched the first season, but now by season 4 he is one of my favorite characters. They manage to squeeze a lot of personality out of the little bit of screen time he has.
* Callum doing dark magic once and regretting it, but it still having lasting implications even after the time skip is a very well fired Chekhov's gun.
* The Aaravos mystery being set up from episode one makes it the most intriguing arc the series probably has to offer. I am just guessing at this point, but he is going to end up being either inside the magic cube, or somewhere in Katolis. Also, he's voiced by Erik Dellums, who - to me - will always be Three Dog ([insert howl here]) from Fallout 3, and that makes me happy.

Ultimately, I think a lot of the issues I have with the show probably boil down to two major things:
1) It has half the episodes per season that ATLA did. A lot of the world and characters don't get as fleshed out as they seem to be in the writers heads because of this.
2) Even if they had gotten the time required in point 1, I feel like it would have been used for more soap boxing, and less character building. Again, I blame Twitter.`,

The entire premise of the show is based on having a set amount of characters whose storylines slowly converge. This is handled fantastically for about 80% of the plotlines.
The first plotline we ever get introduced to is an old man reading a story to a young girl. Seemingly, this plotline was just completely forgotten, as it's brought up maybe one more time, but never goes anywhere.
The plotline of the guy in the white tux gets about 75% done, then just stops.

"You need to watch the OVAs!", you say. First of all, the story already concluded. You can't just patch together a second ending because you forgot to end some plotlines. Second of all, within the first 5 minutes of the first OVA, we:
1) Are off the train (which was the entire premise of the show)
2) Introduce new characters (completely missing the point of what made the original premise so interesting)
I stopped watching halfway through the first OVA, just because it felt like a desperate attempt to either keep the money flowing, or to "fix" the misses in the actual ending.

If it had resolved the remaining plotlines within the premise of the train, and not start introducing new characters, this would easily have been an 8/10. It's honestly sad that they fumbled the ending so hard.`,

The fact that 90% of the game feels like a generic fantasy thing, with no relation to the franchise whatsoever? The combat at least starts out fun, but quickly devolves into tedium (although unlocking the explosive barrel thing near the end was a nice change of pace).

This is a mediocre game by most metrics. Any open world game has two tasks to fulfill:
1) Have a big, sprawling, beautiful open world - this game checks that box.
2) Make the world feel rewarding to explore (not just through sheer amount of content, but also through variety) - this is where the game (like any other ubisoft open world game) fails.

There are a lot of things I could go into and nitpick (the console-first design that cripples the PC experience, the map being SO SLOW TO OPEN PLEASE I JUST WANT TO LOOK WHERE I'M GOING, the same four-ish enemies over and over, ...), but I'll simply say this:
The focus in development was clearly the quests. Follow the developers directive, and focus on the quests as well. Ignore actually exploring the world, and just look at it as it passes by below, when you fly on your broom. If you like Harry Potter, this'll scratch that itch.

And yes, I did 100% the game.`,

The dragon is meant to be some sort of diety, spirituality in general, the unknown, the loss of a loved one, or anything else in the general ballpark of "frightening world".
The young boy, seeking answers to a scary world, seeks the knowledge of those that came before him, in the form of a book. Focusing on the wrong thing entirely, he ignores the people holding the bowl, and focuses on the bowl itself.
Presumably, he thinks appeasing the dragon with an offering will appease it (read: making the outside world less scary), and he sets out on an adventure to do just that. The dragon ultimately rejects him, engulfing his world in darkness.

By the end of the game, we find out that the entire game takes place in the memories of the old man. He himself sees the connections of his past selves and the fruits that he carried.
However, it's only now that he has all this experience that he realizes that the fruits were a metaphor, and why the people offering the bowl were as important as the bowl itself.
Through his rememberance, he finally sees the fruits (experiences, emotions) for what they are, and he is finally accepted by the dragon (the world is no longer scary).

The message, presumably, being that chasing (spiritual) answers is no way to live a fruitful life. Instead, you should experience life, and the answers will find you in time.`,

    "description": `A point-and-click puzzle game that takes too much inspiration from the early days of the genre.
The difficulty of about half the puzzles don't come from complexity or innovating on mechanics, but tedium and guesswork. Some even require real world knowledge not gainable in game, which is always a big no-no.
With a guide by your side for when you get stuck, the better designed puzzles and the story are decent enough to warrant a playthrough.

Spoilers for a handful of puzzles that I felt indicative of the games flaws:
* Having to guess the name of the person in the ouija board scene, as there are seemingly no hints whatsoever to who it is, besides the name being mentioned in a note nearby (along with a bunch of other names - guesswork).
* The music puzzles require you to know how to play piano (or at least how a piano is layed out). The do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do puzzle also requires you to know which corresponds to which note. All without any hints to how a piano is layed out or anything of the sort in game. Requiring real world knowledge is always bad.
* Having to give Anton his glyph thing requires far too much investment in order to complete 1.5 puzzles. Even when you do understand it, it's tedium to actually solve. Shame, because it was one of the more interesting parts in the story.
* Haborym's pendant puzzle, where the pieces don't fit together, is just poor UX design.
* The "paper trail" quest requiring you to just find a random book as the first step on the trail is a weird choice. While I can understand that, from a writing standpoint, perhaps the characters thought the word "chariot" to be intrinsically linked with the book, the player most likely does not.`,

    "description": `In many ways, a complete upgrade of the previous game in the series. In other ways, a step back.

There is a LOT of nice stuff here. All the good stuff from the previous game, and more. Movement flows even better, combat (for the most part) is both improved and more varied, the world feels more rewarding to explore, the story - although predictable - is enjoyable, and so on.
However, as with most things, the flaws stick out far more than the good stuff. The game often suffers from what I'm guessing is a "too many cooks" situation - there is no coherent understanding of what the game wants as an identity. For example:
* The game has a block and riposte system, but the riposte is seemingly no more damage than a regular attack. The game also actively punishes you for trying to use the system, since if you miss the first parry, you can only block for the remainder of the opponents attack flurry (or at least for a time? Not sure how the mechanics work here).
* The game has a dodge system, but you cannot dodge more than two times in quick succession without getting punished. On its own that doesn't sound bad, but when most late-game enemies having an attack radius bigger than a single dodge, it becomes a problem.
* The game is designed for one-on-one combat (especially when you take the above points into consideration), but the game constantly uses enemy/boss spam in order to up the difficulty. None of the systems in the game work well when you are trying to manage multiple enemies. Even the "Swap targeted enemy" function barely does what you want it to, as it only cares about horizontal changes, and not vertical ones. If there are two enemies are in front of each other, the one in the back being targeted, and I hit down, it should swap to the one in front. It should NOT do nothing.

These issues, along with a few other deadly design sins (some listed below), nets the game a lower rating than the core gameplay loop deserves.
* Instant kill attacks. There is a very distinct line between challenging and time wasting, and these types of shenanigans are exclusively on the "time wasting" side (along with enemies that heal themselves, and ones that stun you for an extended period of time. The healing one I didn't run across/notice in this game though). The mindset behind these mechanics is a relic of the quarter-eating arcade days, and that's where it should have stayed.
* Health spam. A lot of bosses are just really tanky for seemingly no other reason than for the combat to take longer.
* Questionable hitboxes. This seemingly mostly an issue with the big, non-human enemies. I can't tell you how many times I got damaged by one of the Oggdo AFTER its attack animation was finished, and/or I was standing to the side of it. Not to mention the Rancor grab.
* The game forces you into a boss battle while you're playing as a completely new, different character, who you never play as again. A boss battle is supposed to test the skills you've honed up until that point, and by taking them away (and introducing "new" ones), you don't get that.

However, I should mention that most of my issues with combat only really arose when fighting non-humanoid enemies, which is a fairly small percentage of the fights overall. A surprisingly large chunk of bosses though.

I decided to rewatch the first season along with watching season 2. I remember being surprised that the show was renewed after the first season, considering I felt that the message of the last episode was that the entire premise of the show was a bad idea.

The first season is a great psychological exploration of parenthood, child actors, whether taking rehearsing to this level is good for any of the people involved, and a lot of other things. It's clear there's no defined goal. Perhaps the idea originally was to make something more episodic (similar to Nathan for You), only to stumble into the plot of the season?

The second season, on the other hand, clearly does have a goal in mind. The first episode explains it clearly - having had a personal interest in aviation, Nathan wonders if its OK to use the budget of a comedy show to try and solve a real problem.

While the second season is very good in its own right, I feel it suffers standing in the shadow of the first. It's good, but it's not <i>as</i> good. Although maybe that's just me.`,

Throughout I was often reminded of Annihilation. Seeing as they share the same director (something I looked up afterwards), it makes a lot of sense.
The cinematography is great, but it does drag some points on longer than they needed to, especially early on. The choice of music is similarly polarising; sometimes it's great, sometimes it's strange. The lead actress also overenunciates at certain points (but not always), reminding me of someone trying to hide their natural accent, or just starting out voice acting.

All the above are just minor nitpicks, and I would say that if you're into the more philosophical angle of sci-fi, you'll love this.`,

Having played none of the Remedy games between this and Alan Wake, this is a big step up in every department.
The story feels much more fleshed out, and not as much of a "babbys first cosmic horror". There's a lot of thought put into the universe, and how it's all presented.

The ending felt off, as if they had to not do the final bossfight due to budget reasons, and opted to just cut to black instead. Same with the post-story DLC "The Foundation", which has a far better ending, but (presumably since it's a DLC) doesn't actually offer up an ending to the game itself. Both of these issues end up making the game give no real sense of closure.

That, along with some gripes with the core gameplay loop (flying controls, and the fact that the service weapon is next to pointless once you get the throwing ability) nets it the score it gets. It could easily have reached at least 9 otherwise.`,

Tried to learn it because the syntax looked nice. Immediately ran into several problems, all of them having to do with the import system:
* You have to have go installed in order to write functional code, not just to execute it (since you apparently have to run go mod every 2 seconds). This means that its impossible to dockerize it in a reasonable manner (i.e. writing code locally, executing it in the docker image).
* For some dumbfuck reason, they've decided to abstract the imports away from "I want that file over there", which is all an import system should ever be. Anything else just introduces a shitton of overhead for the programmer for no reason.
* The recommended WoW is to name your module after the URL where you can find it, meaning modules will have long ass names that make no sense (github usernames, for example). In addition, you have to specify the import in each file that is going to use it, meaning you have to remember what all the dumbass long names are, and you seemingly can't alias them.
* You can't tell how to use module once its imported by just looking at the code. "import github.com/foo/bar.gov" can apparently result in a module named "banana". ?????????????
* Why the <i>fuck</i> do I have to define a new module in order to put a function in a separate file?
* <a href="https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/call-module-code">This entire tutorial</a>, and the fact that apparently this is both official, accepted, and even considered good.

I was looking for a language to write a webserver in, and since I don't want to write the entire implementation in one file, this language is entirely useless for the purpose.
Maybe it's good for one-file scripts, but I don't see why you would use it over python, which is already installed <i>everywhere</i>.

The only good thing I can say about it is that the syntax looks nice, and that the pointer belongs to the type, not the variable.`,

Having rewatched the entire Cornetto trilogy recently, I'm left with some thoughts - about The World's End specifically, but also about the entire trilogy in its whole.
What makes these movies so good to me is not just the execution, but the (perceived) concept behind them as well. They're all parodies of specific types of movies, and they all parody the very concept of character growth.

Shaun of the Dead is about a "loser" who, in any other zombie movie, would end up as the "cool guy", or the "hero". But instead, he doesn't transform whatsoever. He stays who he is, which is the main focus of the entire movie. The movie starts out with telling us about his regular plans (going to the pub with "the guys"), and shows us how he continually chooses to go back to that same formula over and over again. Even after the crisis is over, he stays the same.

Hot Fuzz is about a cop who sees everything in black and white, who gets thrust into a scenario where everything is gray. He clears the gray fog surrounding him, and sees that it was all just a black and white that people were trying to hide, meaning that he never actually changes. He does this to the point where the only real character growth in the movie makes him an actively worse cop, by embracing the "badass cop" genre the entire movie is a parody of to begin with.

The World's End is about a man who doesn't know his place in the adult, modern world; a man who wants to relive his high school glory days, and it ends with him doing just that. It seemingly takes it a step further in the "lmao character growth" department than its predecessors, by recognizing the type of person who didn't see the parody aspects of the first two films, and integrating that type of personality into the main character of the finale to the trilogy. A highly exaggerated version of said persona, but said persona nontheless. In doing that, they not only parody the genre and character growth, but also - in some sense - the last two movies of its own trilogy.

I'd rate all of the movies individually in the mid to high sevens, but when you look at the trilogy as a whole, I'd rate it closer to a high eight/low nine, mainly due to this pseudo-related narrative.`,

Fits well into the Fallout universe, but doesn't have the same absurdist humor vibes that the games do. But, at the same time, I acknowledge that keeping up with the games on that front wouldn't really work in a cinematic format.
Reveals some things that have been kept secret in the Fallout lore, which feels like a weird choice, but I can live with it.
The story is largely the same as Fallout 3, but that doesn't really matter.

1) A more philosophical look into science, religion, and the link between. Perhaps using an alien force as an overwhelming god.
2) Similar to 1, but more of a cosmic horror vibe than a sci-fi vibe.
Unfortunately, it felt like it went with the simpler, basic bitch option of 3.

That being said, the basic bitch option is executed as well as it could have been (I assume, not having read the source material).
It does however lean a bit too heavily on the interpersonal relationships of the characters in the show, rather than the premise itself... at least for my tastes.`,

There are a lot of things that could be improved with this game. Nothing is bad outright, but nothing individually feels as good as it could/should either.
* The combat varies from really fluent and good to really wonky and (feeling, but not being) unresponsive.
* The game apparently registered me as embracing two people, even though I was very careful to never do such a thing. This unfortunately locked me out of the true ending, but what else is YouTube for?
* The sickness mechanic was a good idea, but at the end all it does is make you have to run around a bunch each time you want to level up. Scarcity of ingredients, changes to characters when sick, maybe not even being able to finish quests, and other such changes would have made the mechanic feel much more involved.
* A fair bit of the game feel rushed. Some quests feel half done. Once you've finished all the quests in an area there's basically no reason to go back, and (for the most part), you can do all quests day 1 when you get to an area.
But by God if it doesn't ooze with charm out of everywhere it can muster. Every time I got frustrated due to dodging not working (which was sometimes justified, but it doesn't give enough of a response to the button inputs to make it feel valid), abilities not triggering, and somehow attacking around enemies, the love the game is crafted with drew me back in right away.

It really deserves a more polished sequel.

Very cozy and enjoyable game. Has that over the top anime vibe, but without stepping over the line into annoying.

There are only a few points that I didn't find great:
1) With the amount of busy work, events, side quests, and such, it's very difficult to feel like you can take the time to do what you want. For example: from the time I got my first email event to the time I finished the game, I had one day where I didn't have <i>something</i> coming up soon
2) The randomly generated map feels like it detracts more from the game than it adds. If we had gotten something similar to the moving around sequence you get in the Dredge DLC, where you can choose <i>where</i> you want to dive, it would have worked a lot better. For example: as it is, it's just annoying to try and three-star your Pokédex, since the fish you want only spawns in the seaweed jungle.
3) The combat mechanics feel underpolished in comparison to the rest of the game. Not being able to aim fully up/down is annoying, but what really annoyed me is the fact that the controls in combat are unreliable. It seems the game listens to "button down" events, instead of "button held" events. This leads to situations where you may get hit and try to retaliate, but the game didn't register the fact that you right clicked due to the fact that the hit animation had 2 frames left. So instead, you stab the enemy with your knife, which doesn't "stun" it. Swapping weapons while paralyzed, and a bunch of other situations all suffer the same fate.
4) The fact that different plants grow at different speeds ended up being annoying more than helpful, since it meant that you had to go to the farm three times per day instead of once.

That being said, I did enjoy my time. The core gameplay loop is solid, and the issues with combat are something you can get used to, even if it doesn't feel great.

It's incredible how a really janky, relatively short, relatively low on content game can outclass many modern AAA games in terms of how good it feels to play. Don't get me wrong, there is a <i>lot</i> of jank, especially coming from a modern game perspective, but there's so much charm and thought put into the game.

Giving you a rudimentary system for interacting with the world, and then having said system be <i>the only way</i> to interact with the world, is great. The game lets you actually interact with it. You don't get a "Kill X" or "Spare X" moment, you get to talk to X then decide yourself if you walk away or not. There's no real frontloading of choice, because you have the exact same choices all the time. This is something even modern "immersive sims" don't seem to grasp well, at least from the ones I've tried. Give me something like this game, but with an expansive and filled world like Morrowind, and I'd play it over and over.

The fact that you have to find constellations yourself is a weird mechanic. I'd recommend just looking up an unlock guide, since that part of the game really doesn't add anything. Other than that, pretty solid. Voice acting is dodgy at times, but that's not the focus of the game.`,

    "description": `Overall very good, but suffers from a few polish-level design decisions that drag the experience down. A few:
* You can't pick your bloodstain up directly as a bossfight starts, it's only possible about a second after. This seemingly goes for any interactable (stand in front of a bonfire and see how long it takes for the prompt to show up), but it's especially noticeable with the bloodstains.
* The unbound counter doesn't activate when you release the button, but half a second afterwards. You can see the animation start, but still get hit. For a reaction-based game such as this, having any delay in the combat is a strange choice
* Steely Jade doesn't actually do what the description says it does. It only protects you during the standing still phase, not during the part where you move. Maybe that's what they mean by 'detonation', but that vocabulary doesn't show up in the rest of the game, so it's hard to know. Even if it does, it obviously doesn't stand out enough.
* The input buffering mechanic doesn't work very well. I think there is one (it feels like it), but sometimes it doesn't trigger. Healing right after you've parried, for example.

It also suffers from quite a few of the things mentioned in <a href="/rants/the-decline-of-soulslikes">The Decline of Soulslikes</a>:
* The Demand for Perfection
* Removing Player Progress
* Style Over Substance

The 3rd phase of the final boss definitely passes the 'fun' barrier, and enters into 'tedious', since it's 50% visual noise.

That being said, the other bossfights were fantastic - they all felt unique, and all fairly balanced (although I did poision Jiequan, so unsure how he works without it). Ji was definitely the best one.
Shuanshuan is a goober, and I wish him all the best.`,

Jim Carrey is great as usual, hope he returns for the next one.
The next one being Amy-focused makes sense.
If they're gonna make one movie per character, I'll gladly watch each one. The Rouge one is gonna be weird, and the Big the Cat one is gonna be the best one.`,

Sure, there are some (countable on one hand) puzzles with some moon logic to them (the cave crystal puzzle, for example), but with guides and walkthroughs being readily available, that isn't much of a hassle.
Despite that, it's a great game, and a good story with well defined characters.

Mainly the fact that it's designed for you to grind, but it doesn't give you level appropriate enemies to grind on, meaning you never get a decent amount of EXP. When a gym leader has pokemon 15 or so levels above the wild ones nearby, you easily run into the issue.
