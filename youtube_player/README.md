# youtube_player
For when you don't want to keep creating YouTube playlists, or when you want to loop a YouTube playlist.  
A playlist is saved in the URL, so just save a bookmark to save the playlist.  
You can add "autoplay=index" to have the video at that index autoplay when the site is loaded (0 indexed).
